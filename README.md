# ColorClock

ColorClock stands as a minimalist lean-to shade structure, housing a 2.5 ft diameter light display at its core. Within, a low bench invites participants to rest just above the playa. The light display, crafted with concentric circles, marks the current time, providing nuanced granularity such as the hour and minute. A user-controllable central light introduces an element of interactivity. With an intuitive control panel, the participant can manage cycle time and spectrum hues, enhancing the understanding of the piece. ColorClock, in its simplicity and interactivity, prompts contemplation on the temporal interplay of light against the expansive backdrop of the playa landscape.
