# Back In Development

I would like to make the ColorClock code base more robust, so I
decided to leverage some of the work I'm doing in my real job and
applying it to ColorClock.

## Google Test

During development of ColorClock Version 1, I did some rudimentary
unit tests that took the form of print statements in simple C++
programs. I played around with writing makefiles but my unit tests were
few and far between.

In my latest work, I'm implementing a "real" unit testing framework in
using Google Test. Each module has its own test file and I'm using
**make** to build the unit test executable.

## Testing Limitations

Since ColorClock is designed to work with specific hardware, some of the
code isn‚Äôt easily testable using Google Test. However, much (or at least
some) of the hardware-dependent functionality is protected by
preprocessor directives, providing alternate behavior for non-hardware
builds. My goal is to write unit tests for as many functions as
possible.

## This Is Why We Test

So, I‚Äôve started writing tests for the edge cases in the TimeCalcs
module, and guess what? I found some errors in one of the functions üòÖ

I didn't run into these issues with ColorClock Version 1 because it was
built for a specific use case, but as I expand the project, I need to
address them üò¨

## Build Flags

I have a file called [flux_macros.hpp](https://github.com/rebeccajr/color-clock/blob/main/sw/arduino/color-clock-driver/flux-macros.hpp)
that defines all the build flags, including preprocessor directives for
enabling hardware-specific functionality. This file is included in every
software module. One of its macros, **DEBUG_CPP**, is meant for
non-hardware builds. Until now, I‚Äôve had to manually set this flag in
the macros file. To streamline the process, I wrote a simple
[Python script](https://github.com/rebeccajr/color-clock/blob/main/sw/test/build-test/add-debug-macros.py) that automatically uncomments the line.

```cpp
// #define DEBUG_CPP
```

and converts it to:

```cpp
#define DEBUG_CPP
```

In the [makefile](https://github.com/rebeccajr/color-clock/blob/main/sw/test/build-test/Makefile)
for the unit tests, I create a phony target that runs the Python script
first before building out the unit test executable üòé

## File Headers

Another improvement I made to give the code a more professional look was
adding a comment header to each file. To make this process more
efficient, I wrote a Python script that automatically populates the
header in each file.

```cpp
//__________________________________________________________________
//__________________________________________________________________
//      _   __   _   _ _   _   _   _         _
// |   |_| | _  | | | V | | | | / |_/ |_| | /
// |__ | | |__| |_| |   | |_| | \ |   | | | \_
//  _  _         _ ___  _       _ ___   _                   / /
// /  | | |\ |  \   |  | / | | /   |   \                   (^^)
// \_ |_| | \| _/   |  | \ |_| \_  |  _/                   (____)o

*We named our artist collective (currently me, Bo, and our friend Cody)
'Lagomorphic Constructs.' Lagomorpha is the taxonomic order that
includes rabbits‚Äîand I love rabbits. So, naturally, I went with
'Lagomorphic Constructs' üê∞*

## Home Display

On a different note, we are also working on installing the light display
for ColorClock Version 1 in the house üè†

I powered it up for the first time since its display at Burning Man
2024 and was thrilled to see that not only did it work, but
the time was still accurate thanks to the 'real-time clock module üéâ

The first step to converting it to a home display is to sort out the
wiring...

*For ColorClock Version 1, the light display's wiring was terminated
with a Molex connector, which connected to a wire harness. The harness
then led to a 12-way terminal block mounted on the structure, which
interfaced with the electronics box.*

The diagram above was generated using DOT, a scripting language for
creating vector images. It's another technology I use at work and have
recently started incorporating into ColorClock.

*For home display, we removed the wire harness from Version 1 and directly connected the LED strips to the terminal block, which we relocated to the back of the light display.*

## TODO

Moving forward, I have a few tasks on my to-do list that I‚Äôll continue
chipping away at...

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for modules:
  - TimeCalcs
  - RgbColor
  - HsvColor
  - ColorClock
  - TimeController
  - TimeDisplay
  - TopLevel
- Fix code for failures found during unit testing
- Create a pipeline that runs all unit tests

## Documentation

- Make block diagrams of the software architecture of ColorClock using
  DOT
- Add Doxygen comments and generate documentation

## Cleanup

- Organize ColorClock classes into folders
- Clean up non-Arduino code

## Hardware

- Prototype a small harware version of the light display for testing
  purposes
- Research free PCB board layout programs
