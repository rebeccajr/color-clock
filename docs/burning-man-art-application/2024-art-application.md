# Description
This file contains the art registration questionaire for a Burning Man art piece.

# RIDE
ColorClock aligns with the values of Radical Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (R.I.D.E.) by integrating a user-friendly interface transcends technical barriers. The user interface of ColorClock is intentionally designed to be simple and intuitive, ensuring accessibility for participants with varying levels of technical knowledge. This deliberate simplicity extends beyond technical accessibility; as ColorClock represents time without traditional numbers, it becomes an invaluable tool for those who may face challenges processing conventional time information.

# Roles and Skills on Playa
Supervisor & LNT Lead (Rebecca): Oversees and directs installation and deinstallation, ensuring strict adherence to Leave No Trace (LNT) principles. Maintains vigilant oversight, proactively identifying and rectifying MOOP issues like loose nails.

Construction Lead (Gary): Manages tasks, overseeing precise assembly using tools (hammers, nails, screwdrivers, drills) for optimal completion.

Assistant Constructor (Cody): Supports the Construction Lead, ensuring efficient and accurate manual processes.

Electronics Lead (Rebecca): Assembles and maintains electronic components, ensuring seamless functionality and integration.

Electronics Assistant (Gary): Aids the Electronics Lead, focusing on wiring solar panels.

Rigging Team (Cody and Gary):
Manages rigging, anchoring the installation to the Playa for stability and safety.

Efficient execution with attention to quality, functionality, safety, and precise LNT practices.

# Physical Description
The ColorClock is a minimalist lean-to shade structure featuring a 2.5 ft diameter light display at its center. Inside, a short bench allows participants to sit just above the playa surface. The light display consists of concentric circles delineating the current time, offering varying granularity (e.g., hour, minute). A central light, user-controllable, add interactivity. The structure incorporates an uncomplicated, intuitive control panel enabling users to manage cycle time and spectrum hues efficiently.

# Philosophy
ColorClock defies conventional time quantification. At Burning Man, where many seek liberation from the constraints of order and time in the default world, this piece instigates reflection. By using color variation instead of numeric precision, ColorClock underscores the imprecise nature of time, emphasizing our imperfect reality. My objective is to convey a profound message about embracing temporal fluidity and acknowledging inherent limitations in our perceptions. This installation invites participants to a contemplative exploration, fostering a connection with the unmeasured essence of existence.

# Public Description
ColorClock stands as a minimalist lean-to shade structure, housing a 2.5 ft diameter light display at its core. Within, a low bench invites participants to rest just above the playa. The light display, crafted with concentric circles, marks the current time, providing nuanced granularity such as the hour and minute. A user-controllable central light introduces an element of interactivity. With an intuitive control panel, the participant can manage cycle time and spectrum hues, enhancing the understanding of the piece. ColorClock, in its simplicity and interactivity, prompts contemplation on the temporal interplay of light against the expansive backdrop of the playa landscape.

# Safety
ColorClock prioritizes occupant safety with a 'no climbing' sign, sanded edges to prevent splinters, and meticulously terminated and grounded electronics, eliminating exposed wires. No specific staffing is designated during the event, relying on these safety features and participant awareness for a secure experience.

# Installation plan

Team will perform tasks simultaneously, e.g. electronics assembly during structure assembly. No heavy machinery necessary.

# Lighting Plan
In addition to the light of the LED art itself, there will be solar lawn lights staked into the ground at all four corners and two more along the two shorter edges of the art perimeter, where it won't create a trip hazard for participants. If construction is performed at night, we will use these same solar lights in addition to rope lights to outline our area of work.

# Aesthetic Light Components

The heart of the piece is the 2.5 foot diameter circular ColorClock light display, RGB LEDs. It will be visible through the open side of the lean-to shade structure

# Placement
9:00 side, inner playa

# Deinstallation

We plan to disassemble on Sunday afternoon before the temple burn in the following steps:

1. Deploy expansive tarps strategically surrounding and positioned beneath the installation to capture any potential MOOP during disassembly. Place an additional tarp where disassembled materials will be gathered.

2. Disconnect and remove solar lights, and detach the light display from the shade panel.

3. Remove solar panels and deconstruct the bench.

4. Uninstall shade panels, collecting fasteners systematically.

5. Disassemble the frame, ensuring the organized collection of all fasteners.

6. Diligently fold all tarps laid out in step one, taking care to retain any collected MOOP, if present, ensuring a meticulous cleanup.

7. Conduct a thorough linear sweep of the art area with three team members, scrutinizing the Playa meticulously for any MOOP (Matter Out of Place) left behind.


#LNT plan


To mitigate potential MOOP issues during both installation and deinstallation, our strategy involves proactive measures to safeguard the playa surface. Large tarps will be strategically positioned under the installation to capture any debris, and additional tarps will be laid where materials are assembled and disassembled, ensuring a clean and organized workspace.

Recognizing that wood fasteners pose a significant MOOP concern, we will meticulously organize and count them during both assembly and disassembly. Prior to Playa installation, all wood components will undergo sanding to minimize the risk of wood shards becoming MOOP.

In adherence to Leave No Trace principles, our post-deinstallation cleanup plan includes raking the area surrounding the art piece to restore the playa to its original condition. This comprehensive approach aligns with our commitment to environmental responsibility throughout the entire project lifecycle.

# After Event
We will reuse the frame and wood panels for future art. The light display will be used as an art piece in the house.

# Modifications
The light display will be disassembled from the shade structure. We will also change the the wiring so it can be powered from a wall outlet.
