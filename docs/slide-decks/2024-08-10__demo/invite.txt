This year, we've poured our hearts and energy into ColorClock, an RGB LED art piece that we will proudly display at Burning Man 2024. After countless trips to Home Depot, numerous challenges with hardware interfacing, and invaluable lessons in construction and electronic design, we are thrilled to announce that we are in the final stages of ColorClock V0 and would love to have you join us for a live demo!

⏰🌈

What to expect:

☀️ LIVE DEMO: See ColorClock in action.
☀️ INTERACTIVE PRESENTATION: Learn about the inspiration and technology behind ColorClock.
️☀️️ HANDS ON EXPERIENCE: Explore and engage with its controls.

⏰🌈

We're doing this potluck style!

Come hungry and bring your favorite dish to share 😋 We'll have a delicious variety of healthy homemade comestibles and beverages for everyone to enjoy.

Let us know if you have any dietary restrictions so we can accommodate.

⏰🌈

Feel free to extend this invitation to friends and family. If possible, please include them in your RSVP, but it's also okay to bring someone last minute!

⏰🌈
